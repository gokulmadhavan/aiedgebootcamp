## Prompts to ChatGPT

### Initial prompt
I want to create a Streamlit app that takes a prompt from the user and creates an image using HuggingFace models. (I have a HuggingFace API token stored in my .env.) I want to have 3 model options to choose from as a dropdown:
* Flux-Midjourney-Mix2-LoRA
* black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev
* Stable diffusion
The app should have a dropdown and a download button for the image.
Access my HuggingFace token from my .env file.

### Edited prompt
I get the following error: 
```
"Failed to generate image. Please check the model and prompt."
```
